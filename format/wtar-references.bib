Superimposed are two predicted latent class trajectories (blue ribbon = `High performers', brown ribbon = `Typical'). Blue and brown connecting lines link observations within individuals from each class. (B) Mean z-score from multiple tests in a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, showing only those Parkinson's participants who developed dementia. Their overall cognitive performance declined dramatically, in contrast to their relatively stable WTAR scores. To illustrate this, two individuals are highlighted (with larger symbols and thicker connecting lines), showing their flat WTAR trajectories despite dramatic declines in overall neuropsychological performance. In each panel, current cognitive status is shown as cognitively normal (green circles), mild cognitive impairment (orange triangles), or dementia (red squares). Upon reaching dementia, the WTAR was not assessed again},

@article{statucka2019_OriginsMatterCulture,
	abstract = {Cognitive decline is common in Parkinson's disease (PD), and precise cognitive assessment is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. To date, there are no studies in PD investigating cultural bias on neuropsychological tests. Clinical practice in multicultural societies such as, Toronto Canada where nearly half of the population is comprised of first generation immigrants, presents important challenges as most neuropsychological tools were developed in Anglosphere cultures (e.g., USA, UK) and normed in more homogeneous groups. We examine total scores and rates of deficits on tests of visuoperceptual/visuospatial, attention, memory, and executive functions in Canadians with PD born in Anglosphere countries (n = 248) vs. in Canadians with PD born in other regions (International group; n = 167). The International group shows lower scores and greater rates of deficits on all visuoperceptual and some executive function tasks, but not on attention or memory measures. These biases are not explained by demographic and clinical variables as groups were comparable. Age at immigration, years in Canada, and English proficiency also do not account for the observed biases. In contrast, group differences are strongly mediated by the Historical Index of Human Development of the participants' country of birth, which reflects economic, health, and educational potential of a country at the time of birth. In sum, our findings demonstrate lasting biases on neuropsychological tests despite significant exposure to, and participation in, Canadian culture. These biases are most striking on visuoperceptual measures and non-verbal executive tasks which many clinicians still considered to be ``culture-fair'' despite the growing evidence from the field of cross-cultural neuropsychology to the contrary. Our findings also illustrate that sociodevelopment context captures important aspects of culture that relate to cognition, and have important implications for clinical practice.},

@article{statucka2021_MulticulturalismChallengeCognitive,
	abstract = {Background: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Dementia Rating Scale-2 (DRS-2) are recommended screeners for Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI). Cross-cultural studies examining their diagnostic precision have not addressed cultural bias in a multicultural setting.
Objectives: To compare DRS-2 and MoCA performance between patients born in Canada, the USA, and the UK (Anglosphere group) and immigrant patients born elsewhere (International group). To identify sources of cultural bias by comparing group characteristics, and by assessing the relationships between performance and immigration and socio-development variables. To examine the diagnostic precision of both tools in detecting PD-MCI in each group.
Methods: We conducted a clinical chart review of advanced PD patients who completed cognitive screeners (MoCA: n=288, 30\% International group; DRS-2: n=426, 31\% International group). All completed a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to apply Level II PDMCI diagnostic criteria.
Results: The International group performed worse than the Anglosphere group on the MoCA and DRS-2, and the only variable that accounted for some of the group difference was the Historical Index of Human Development, a societal variable, which fully mediated the group effect on the DRS-2. Diagnostic precision of the MoCA was at chance level in the International group, and was poorer than that of the DRS-II in this group and that of the MoCA in the Anglosphere group, although these were considered poor.
Conclusions: Our results support the recommendation to exert caution in using cognitive screeners to capture PD-MCI in all patients and particularly with first generation immigrants.},

	abstract = {The experience of brain injury changes the world for the person
experiencing it and their family. It is important for health providers to know as accurately as possible how severe the brain damage is to be able to deliver the appropriate level of treatment and rehabilitation. Tests are available to measure current cognitive functioning which can be expressed as an intelligence quotient (IQ). One such test is the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). Other tests are able to estimate premorbid IQ, for example the National Adult Reading Test (NART), the Test of Premorbid Functioning (TOPF) and the New Zealand Adult Reading Test (NZART). The discrepancy between the current IQ and the estimated premorbid IQ scores provides an estimate of the decrease in cognitive function as a result of brain injury. Most of these IQ tests have not been developed or normed for the New Zealand population and their suitability for this population is therefore not known. This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the tests of premorbid IQ to estimate the current WAIS-IV IQ in a New Zealand sample. This sample consisted of 86 New Zealand born, neurologically healthy, men and women (mean age of 46 years), who were administered the WAIS-IV, NART, TOPF and NZART. The results showed that the tests of premorbid IQ significantly over estimated lower IQ scores and significantly under estimated higher IQ scores. New regression formulae for the NART, TOPF and NZART were developed based on the WAIS-IV FSIQ and were found to be only marginally better at predicting current IQ. These new regression formulae also over-and under-estimated current IQ in the lower and upper ranges. The NZART, a New Zealand developed test, showed slightly better performance than the overseas tests. It was concluded that the tests of premorbid
ii
functioning are not very accurate in in their prediction of WAIS-IV current IQ for people in New Zealand and alternative methods of estimating premorbid IQ are suggested.},

@article{bright2020_ComparisonMethodsEstimating,
	abstract = {To evaluate impact of neurological injury on cognitive performance it is typically necessary to derive a baseline (or ``premorbid'') estimate of a patient's general cognitive ability prior to the onset of impairment. In this paper, we consider a range of common methods for producing this estimate, including those based on current best performance, embedded ``hold/no-hold'' tests, demographic information, and word reading ability. Ninety-two neurologically healthy adult participants were assessed on the full Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -- Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV; Wechsler, D. (2008). Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (4th ed.). San Antonio, TX: Pearson Assessment.) and on two widely used word reading tests: National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, H. E. (1982). National Adult Reading Test (NART): For the assessment of premorbid intelligence in patients with dementia: Test manual. Windsor: NFER-Nelson.; Nelson, H. E., \& Willison, J. (1991). National Adult Reading Test (NART). Windsor: NFER-Nelson.) and Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; Wechsler, D. (2001). Wechsler Test of Adult Reading: WTAR. San Antonio, TX: Psychological Corporation.). Our findings indicate that reading tests provide the most reliable and precise estimates of WAIS-IV full-scale IQ, although the addition of demographic data provides modest improvement. Nevertheless, we observed considerable variability in correlations between NART/WTAR scores and individual WAIS-IV indices, which indicated particular usefulness in estimating more crystallised premorbid abilities (as represented by the verbal comprehension and general ability indices) relative to fluid abilities (working memory and perceptual reasoning indices). We discuss and encourage the development of new methods for improving premorbid estimates of cognitive abilities in neurological patients.},

In view of its importance, the Movement Disorder Society commissioned a task force to delineate diagnostic criteria for mild cognitive impairment in PD. The proposed diagnostic criteria are based on a literature review and expert consensus. This article provides guidelines to characterize the clinical syndrome and methods for its diagnosis. The criteria will require validation, and possibly refinement, as additional research improves our understanding of the epidemiology, presentation, neurobiology, assessment, and long-term course of this clinical syndrome. These diagnostic criteria will support future research efforts to identify at the earliest stage those PD patients at increased risk of progressive cognitive decline and dementia who may benefit from clinical interventions at a predementia stage. {\copyright} 2012 Movement Disorder Society},

@article{lore2020_TrajectoryModellingTechniques,
	abstract = {Trajectory modelling techniques have been developed to determine subgroups within a given population and are increasingly used to better understand intra- and interindividual variability in health outcome patterns over time. The objectives of this narrative review are to explore various trajectory modelling approaches useful to epidemiological research and give an overview of their applications and differences. Guidance for reporting on the results of trajectory modelling is also covered. Trajectory modelling techniques reviewed include latent class modelling approaches, ie, growth mixture modelling (GMM), group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM), latent class analysis (LCA), and latent transition analysis (LTA). A parallel is drawn to other individual-centered statistical approaches such as cluster analysis (CA) and sequence analysis (SA). Depending on the research question and type of data, a number of approaches can be used for trajectory modelling of health outcomes measured in longitudinal studies. However, the various terms to designate latent class modelling approaches (GMM, GBTM, LTA, LCA) are used inconsistently and often inter- changeably in the available scientific literature. Improved consistency in the terminology and reporting guidelines have the potential to increase researchers' efficiency when it comes to choosing the most appropriate technique that best suits their research questions.},

@article{dalrymple-alford2010_MoCAWellsuitedScreen,
	abstract = {Objective: To establish the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when screening externally validated cognition in Parkinson disease (PD), by comparison with a PD-focused test (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease--Cognition [SCOPA-COG]) and the standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (S-MMSE) as benchmarks. Methods: A convenience sample of 114 patients with idiopathic PD and 47 healthy controls was examined in a movement disorders center. The 21 patients with dementia (PD-D) were diagnosed using Movement Disorders Society criteria, externally validated by detailed independent func- tional and neuropsychological tests. The 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) scored 1.5 SD or more below normative data in at least 2 measures in 1 of 4 cognitive domains. Other patients had normal cognition (PD-N). Results: Primary outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that all 3 mental status tests produced excellent discrimination of PD-D from patients without dementia (area under the curve [AUC], 87\%--91\%) and PD-MCI from PD-N patients (AUC, 78\%--90\%), but the MoCA was generally better suited across both assessments. The optimal MoCA screening cutoffs were 21/30 for PD-D (sensitivity 81\%; specificity 95\%; negative predictive value [NPV] 92\%) and 26/30 for PD-MCI (sensitivity 90\%; specificity 75\%; NPV 95\%). Further support that the MoCA is at least equivalent to the SCOPA-COG, and superior to the S-MMSE, came from the simultaneous classification of the 3 PD patient groups (volumes under a 3-dimensional ROC surface, chance 17\%: MoCA 79\%, confidence interval [CI] 70\%--89\%; SCOPA-COG 74\%, CI 62\%--86\%; MMSE- Sevens item 56\%, CI 44\%--68\%; MMSE-World item 62\%, CI 50\%--73\%). Conclusions: The MoCA is a suitably accurate, brief test when screening all levels of cognition in PD.},

@article{dalrymple-alford2011_CharacterizingMildCognitive,
	abstract = {There is growing interest in identifying Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), but widely disparate criteria have been used. We assessed 143 PD patients and 50 matched controls on 20 measures across 4 cognitive domains (executive function, attention and working memory, learning and memory, visuoperception). Twenty-four patients met criteria for dementia (PD-D); nondementia patients were classified as either with nor- mal cognition or MCI for 12 neuropsychological criteria. We compared the influence of these criteria on the dis- tribution of global cognitive performance in the resulting PD-MCI groups relative to the control and PD-D groups. Different criteria produced substantial variation in the proportion of PD-MCI cases identified. Fourteen per cent PD-MCI was found when using 2 scores in 1 domain at 2 standard deviations (SD) below normative scores, with no controls identified as MCI, through to 89\% PD-MCI with 1 score in 1 domain at 1 SD below normative scores, when 70\% of controls were identified as MCI. The balance of cases with impaired cognition but not those with generally intact cognition was better served by using criteria that required 2 specific deficit scores or deficits across 2 domains. As comparisons with external normative data may have greater applic- ability across centers, we suggest that 2 scores at 21.5 SD within any single domain (30\% PD-MCI) or 1 score at 21.5 SD in each of 2 domains (37\% PD-MCI) pro- vide suitable criteria to minimize the inclusion of cogni- tively well patients. Clinical dementia rating did not improve the relative identification of cognitively impaired and unimpaired nondementia PD patients. (c) 2011 Movement Disorder Society},

@article{lennon_framework_2018,
	abstract = {Objectives  Latent class trajectory modelling (LCTM) is a relatively new methodology in epidemiology to describe life-course exposures, which simplifies heterogeneous populations into homogeneous patterns or classes. However, for a given dataset, it is possible to derive scores of different models based on number of classes, model structure and trajectory property. Here, we rationalise a systematic framework to derive a `core' favoured model.
Methods  We developed an eight-step framework: step 1: a scoping model; step 2: refining the number of classes; step 3: refining model structure (from fixed-effects through to a flexible random-effect specification); step 4: model adequacy assessment; step 5: graphical presentations; step 6: use of additional discrimination tools (`degree of separation'; Elsensohn's envelope of residual plots); step 7: clinical characterisation and plausibility; and step 8: sensitivity analysis. We illustrated these steps using data from the NIH-AARP cohort of repeated determinations of body mass index (BMI) at baseline (mean age: 62.5 years), and BMI derived by weight recall at ages 18, 35 and 50 years.
Results  From 288 993 participants, we derived a fiveclass model for each gender (men: 177 455; women: 111 538). From seven model structures, the favoured model was a proportional random quadratic structure (model F). Favourable properties were also noted for the unrestricted random quadratic structure (model G). However, class proportions varied considerably by model structure---concordance between models F and G were moderate (Cohen κ: men, 0.57; women, 0.65) but poor with other models. Model adequacy assessments, evaluations using discrimination tools, clinical plausibility and sensitivity analyses supported our model selection.
Conclusion  We propose a framework to construct and select a `core' LCTM, which will facilitate generalisability of results in future studies.},

@article{proust-lima2017estimation-of-e,
	abstract = {The R package lcmm provides a series of functions to estimate statistical models based on linear mixed model theory. It includes the estimation of mixed models and latent class mixed models for Gaussian longitudinal outcomes (hlme), curvilinear and ordinal univariate longitudinal outcomes (lcmm) and curvilinear multivariate outcomes (multlcmm), as well as joint latent class mixed models (Jointlcmm) for a (Gaussian or curvilinear) longitudinal outcome and a time-to-event outcome that can be possibly left-truncated right-censored and defined in a competing setting. Maximum likelihood esimators are obtained using a modified Marquardt algorithm with strict convergence criteria based on the parameters and likelihood stability, and on the negativity of the second derivatives. The package also provides various post-fit functions including goodness-of-fit analyses, classification, plots, predicted trajectories, individual dynamic prediction of the event and predictive accuracy assessment. This paper constitutes a companion paper to the package by introducing each family of models, the estimation technique, some implementation details and giving examples through a dataset on cognitive aging.},

	abstract = {Estimating models within the mixture model framework, like latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) or latent class growth analysis (LCGA), involves making various decisions throughout the estimation process. This has led to a wide variety in how results of latent trajectory analysis are reported. To overcome this issue, using a 4-round Delphi study, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies (GRoLTS). The purpose of GRoLTS is to present criteria that should be included when reporting the results of latent trajectory analysis across research fields. We have gone through a systematic process to identify key components that, according to a panel of experts, are necessary when reporting results for trajectory studies. We applied GRoLTS to 38 papers where LGMM or LCGA was used to study trajectories of posttraumatic stress after a traumatic event.},

@article{mohs2000_LongitudinalStudiesCognitive,
	abstract = {This paper reviews data on the natural history of symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and describes some of the problems encountered in analysing longitudinal data in this population. Data on cognition, functional ability and psychiatric or behavioural symptoms have all been obtained from AD patients. Because of attrition, the length of follow-up is not uniform for all patients and neither is the frequency of evaluation. Furthermore, patients enter longitudinal studies with a wide range of symptom severity and longitudinal decline in cognition and function is distinctly non-linear. Behavioural symptoms do not progress regularly in AD but are episodic phenomena not closely related to cognition or function. Strengths and limitations of various analytic techniques used for hypothesis testing with these longitudinal data are described. Copyright 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
