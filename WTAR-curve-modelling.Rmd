abstract: Background. A measure of premorbid cognitive function 
  such as the WechslerTest of Adult Reading (WTAR) is recommended to be 
  considered when determining the current cognitive status of people with 
  Parkinson's disease. WTAR scores are known to decline in Alzheimer's disease, 
  however, and it has not been formally demonstrated that they remain stable in 
  spite of the cognitive deterioration that occurs in Parkinson's. 
  Objectives. Assess long-term trajectories of WTAR scores in people with 
  Parkinson's as a function of age. Methods. From 253 Parkinson's and 57 
  Control participants who had completed at least two WTARs, we analysed scores
  using latent class trajectory analysis. Results. WTAR was stable in this 
  sample. Conclusion. The WTAR is a stable measure of premorbid function 
  despite the substantial cognitive decline exhibited by many of the 
  participants.

# Introduction

In 2012, the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society published its Taskforce guidelines for the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD-MCI).[@litvan2012_DiagnosticCriteriaMild] When the diagnosis is based on impairment on specific (rather than global) neuropsychological tests, impairment may be determined in three ways: (i) performance significantly below appropriate norms, or (ii) significant decline on serial testing, or (iii) significant decline from estimated premorbid levels. The latter two approaches could be advantageous in resolving the ambiguity that poor current cognitive function might reflect long-standing low cognitive ability, rather than a recent disease-related deterioration. In practice, however, one seldom has reference to prior formal serial testing, and so a valid method of estimating premorbid function is appealing. The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR) is proposed in the guidelines as one of the two recommended tests to estimate premorbid functioning (along with the National Adult Reading Test, NART). Both tests are based on being able to recognise and pronounce irregularly-spelled English words. ***[TODO: give some examples]*** This ability has been shown to be preserved in the face of both normal ageing and a number of brain insults[@strauss2006_CompendiumNeuropsychologicalTests] 

When the test was initially normed, it was tested in Parkinson's as well as a number of other neurological disorders, such as Huntington's, schizophrenia, and traumatic brain injury. Only in Alzheimer's disease were the scores significantly lower than in matched controls.[@strauss2006_CompendiumNeuropsychologicalTests] ***[TODO - read and insert reference to the Wechsler manual]***. That norming was published in 2001, well before current guidelines on PD-MCI[@litvan2012_DiagnosticCriteriaMild] and Parkinson's dementia diagnosis[@dubois2007_DiagnosticProceduresParkinson] were promulgated. It is therefore unclear to what extent those findings are valid in the face of the significant cognitive deterioration that can occur in Parkinson's.

We therefore firstly sought to examine WTAR scores in a cognitively well-characterised sample, spanning the range from normal function through mild cognitive impairment to dementia, assessed according to the current MDS guidelines. Secondly, we restricted the sample to participants who had completed a minimum of two WTARs, so that the stability of the measure within individuals over time could be examined.    

# Methods

         n_sessions = max(session_num)) %>%

  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), 
            min_sessions = min(n_sessions),
            mean_sessions = mean(n_sessions),
            sd_sessions = sd(n_sessions),
            max_sessions = max(n_sessions))

The New Zealand Parkinson's Progression Programme is a longitudinal study of a convenience prevalence sample of idiopathic Parkinson's, largely recruited from the specialist Movement Disorders Clinic at the New Zealand Brain Research Institute. The study commenced in 2007, with recruitment ongoing, and hence covers patients ranging from the recently-diagnosed to those with advanced disease. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been described previously [@wood2016_DifferentPDMCICriteria]. For this analysis, we selected data only from the `r group_n$n[group_n$group == 'PD']` Parkinson's and `r group_n$n[group_n$group == 'Control']` Control participants who had completed at least two WTARs (range 2 - `r wtar_n$max_sessions`, mean = `r wtar_n$mean_sessions`, total number of measures = `r wtar_n$total_sessions`). The period between successive WTAR assessments was multi-modal, mostly clustering around intervals of one and two years, due to varying follow-up periods over the course of the study. Both patients and controls were classified as having normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia on the basis of a comprehensive neuropsychological battery[@dalrymple-alford2011_CharacterizingMildCognitive; @wood2016_DifferentPDMCICriteria], administered in accordance with MDS guidelines[@dubois2007_DiagnosticProceduresParkinson; @litvan2012_DiagnosticCriteriaMild]. Although the WTAR was assessed during each session, we did not actually use it in the diagnostic classification process: this was done on the basis of test scores falling below 1.5 standard deviations of norms,[@dalrymple-alford2011_CharacterizingMildCognitive; @wood2016_DifferentPDMCICriteria] rather than performance being assessed against an estimated pre-morbid level. Characteristics of the sample are shown in Table \@ref(tab:table-1). All participants were speakers of New Zealand English, and were assessed against the UK/US norms of the WTAR. ***{TODO: Kyla to confirm, and to describe what other factors may have ben applied in deriving the estimated IQ (e.g. age and education).]***

## Latent class trajectory modelling

We fitted latent class trajectory models using the $hlme$ function from the $lcmm$ package [@proust-lima_estimation_2017] (version 1.9.2), running in the R statistical environment [@R-Core-Team_R_2021] (version 4.0.2). The dependent variable was MoCA score, modelled within each subject as a polynomial (cubic) function of age. The model was unaware of any other variables (such as categorical MCI or dementia diagnoses). We fitted five separate models, with the specified number of latent classes increasing from 1 to 5. The model with just one latent class was used to provide starting values for the subsequent models with multiple classes. For each of the multi-class models, an estimation function was run 100 times using an automatic grid search to estimate the parameters while avoiding local minima ***?or maxima? Check with Daniel & Reza on the phrasing of this process.***. Parameters corresponding to the best log-likelihood were used as initial values for the final estimation of the parameters [@proust-lima_estimation_2017]. Selection of the optimal model was on the basis of selecting the one with the lowest BIC value.

```{r table-1}
table_df = dat %>% 
  group_by(subject_id_num) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  slice_tail() %>% # last observation per subject
  group_by(group) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(),
            Male   = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(sex == 'Male')/n),
            Age = paste0(sprintf('%.1f', mean(age)), ' (', sprintf('%.1f',sd(age)), ')'),
            Education = paste0(sprintf('%.1f', mean(education)), ' (', sprintf('%.1f', sd(education)), ')'),
            WTAR = paste0(sprintf('%.1f', mean(WTAR)), ' (', sprintf('%.1f', sd(WTAR)), ')'),
            Normal = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(cognitive_status == 'Normal')/n),
            MCI    = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(cognitive_status == 'MCI')/n),
            Dementia = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 0.1)(sum(cognitive_status == 'Dementia')/n)) %>% 
  mutate(n = as.character(n)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(n:Dementia) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = 'group')

table_df %>% 
  mutate(name = case_when(name == 'Education' ~ 'Education (years)',
                          name == 'Normal'    ~ 'Normal cognition',
                          TRUE                ~ name)) %>% 
  rename(' '           = name,

## Reproducibility

The code and anonymised dataset extracts sufficient to reproduce the analyses and generate this manuscript (using the _papaja_[@aust2020papaja] R Markdown package) are publicly available at https://github.com/nzbri/wtar-trajectory.

- Assess our achievement against one of these guidelines for reporting latent trajectory studies, report in supplementary material: [@lennon_framework_2018; @van_de_schoot_grolts-checklist_2017]

# Results

- See Figure \@ref(fig:figure-1).
- Describe the model selection process.
- Need to describe the form of the single latent class. Currently using a cubic, which isn't great in terms of describing the parameters. Ideally would start with a cubic and then drop back to linear, but that gives odd results we need to discuss (e.g. a 2-class model with a lower BIC but the second class contains only one person).
- What other descriptive results might be useful (e.g. mean within-subject standard deviation of WTAR scores? Not great for those with only two scores, though)? Maybe plot within subject SDs of global z vs WTAR (see supplementary material)?

(ref:fig-1-caption) ***(A.)*** Longitudinal WTAR score trajectories for all individuals, divided into Controls, Parkinson's participants who remained dementia-free, and those who developed dementia. Also shown are the two predicted latent class trajectories (blue ribbon = _High and stable_, brown ribbon = _Gentle decline_). ***(B.)***  Global cognitive z-scores for the Parkinson's participants in the lower panel of ***(A)*** (those who developed dementia). Overall cognitive performance declined dramatically, in contrast to their relatively stable WTARs scores. This was regardless of their latent class (blue and brown lines). In each panel, current cognitive status is shown as cognitively normal (green circles), mild cognitive impairment (orange triangles), or dementia (red squares). Upon reaching dementia, the WTAR was not assessed again.

# Discussion

Relevance to concept of cognitive reserve. This can lead to circular reasoning if the premorbid measure is not reliable. e.g. If a person with PD-MCI has a low measure of premorbid function, then this supports the concept of a strong cognitive reserve being protective against subsequent decline. But if the disease process reduces performance on that measure, then the inference is no longer valid. Evidence of that reliability is required to strengthen inferences in this area.

The WTAR is outdated in that it was originally normed to estimate WAIS-III scores, and WAIS-V is under development.[@bright2020_ComparisonMethodsEstimating] Third party predictions for the current WAID-IV have been published.[@bright2020_ComparisonMethodsEstimating]

The WTAR (and NART) are also limited in that they are inherently tied to peculiarities of English. Many other languages have no such irregularities in the mappings of graphemes to phonemes. In subsequent revisions of the PD-MCI criteria, if premorbid measures continue to be advocated, more attention should be given to alternative techniques[@franzen1997_MethodsEstimatingPremorbid] that could be valid in a wider international context.
